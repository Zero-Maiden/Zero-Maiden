  Hi there, I'm <a href="https://github.com/Zero-Maiden">Albert Liem</a>
</h1>

I like to do a little bit of everything to keep myself from being bored as a hobby. I have many dreams but so little time. My long-term goal is to make significant contributions to the field of technology. I am particularly interested in enhancing my expertise in full-stack web development, with a focus on cloud technologies. Currently, I'm involved in full-stack web development.
