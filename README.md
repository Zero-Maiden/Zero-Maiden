  Hi there, I'm <a href="https://github.com/Zero-Maiden">Albert Liem</a>
</h1>
As a hermit, I like to do a little bit of everything to keep myself from being bored. I have many dreams but so little time. My long-term goal is to make games for the world. Currently, I'm involved in full-stack web development.
